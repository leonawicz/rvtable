rvtable is an R package for storing distributions of random variables in long format data tables with the `rvtable` class. The package provides a simplified and consistent interface for managing and manipulating random variables. The key purpose of rvtable is to carry distributions through an analysis from beginning to end where the distributions are empirically derived from a large data set that is impractical or impossible to keep in original form.

Motivation
----------

A large data set can be sampled to make it more maneagable. This package provides an alternative by estimating the empirical probability density function of a continuous random variable so that the model of the distribution can be carried through analyses in place of the raw observations. This allows sampling from the distribution of a random variable when and however necessary. This is particularly helpful when a sufficient sample size may not be large on its own but when combining in a data frame with samples of many other random variables, or samples of the same variable from different time points, locations, etc., it can lead to a very cumbersome data frame (For efficiency on large data sets, this package relies on data tables).

### Use case and limitations

For example, it is sometimes useful to calculate statistics as the final step in a sequence of intensive data processing operations. It could be that a product to come out of the analysis is a web application where the analyst leaves it to the user to decide interactively which variable(s) to select and what statistics to compute, what to graph and how, whether to exlcude or merge data, etc. This can lead to the problem of having far too much data to put in the application yet not being able to summarize or aggregate the data in advance sufficiently without taking too much away from the user. When there is a lot of data involved, using a relatively efficient representation of a distribution of the data rather than raw observations can help transport the relevant information from one stage of an analysis to another, particularly in a context of limited computing resources or a simple need for speed, such as in an interactive environment involving other users.

The main goals of rvtable are to provide functions for storage, manipulation, and graphing of random variables in the preceding context. This is achieved through:

-   Consistent use of data table structures
-   A number of helper functions for moving between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
-   Generic functions for providing various stock visual comparisons, such as between related marginal and conditional distributions, for various data table-related objects inheriting or deriving from rvtable.

rvtable will not be as useful or even necessary at all for smaller data sets, or discrete random variables with few enough known or observed values, but it can still provide a consistent data structure. It is of no benefit to known distributions with closed mathematical form expressions because there is never a need to lug a ton of such data around in the first place. For example, a random normal distribution can be sampled with `rnorm` at any time. rvtable is helpful for empirical samples which are large and messy, of a complicated form which cannot be reduced to a known or simple combination of known distributions, where an efficient snapshot of the distribution is helpful to avoid juggling excessive amounts of data from one analysis stage to the next while retaining sufficient distributional information.

### Details

What does an RV table hold?

-   An RV table may contain one discrete or continuous random variable.
-   The distribution of the random variable is described in a table using a `Val` column for values and a `Prob` column for associated probabilities.
-   Any other columns in an RV table are ID columns and therefore should only store categorical variables.
-   An RV table is essentially a way of storing the distribution of one random variable in a table or, if ID columns are present in addition to the `Val` and `Prob` columns, sections of rows of the table can be seen as a sequence of conditional distributions based on combinations of the ID variables' levels.

Functions included in the package provide the following abiities:

-   Subset specific conditional distributions from a table
-   Marginalize over/integrate out ID variables to obtain a specified marginal distribution of the random variable
-   Draw random samples from distributions.
-   Invert conditional distributions, i.e., obtain the pmf of a ID variable conditional on a discrete value or range of continuous values of the random variable the table is based on.
