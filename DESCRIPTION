Package: rvtable
Version: 0.6.2.9000
Title: Random Variable Data Tables
Description: Store distributions of random variables in long format data frames
    with the 'rvtable' class. The package provides a simplified and consistent
    interface for managing and manipulating random variables. Random variables can
    be conditioned on levels of categorical variables stored in a table's
    ID columns. Functions provide the ability to condition on/subset, marginalize/
    integrate over, and draw random samples from an rvtable. Emphasis is on
    continuous probability density functions empirically estimated from large samples.
